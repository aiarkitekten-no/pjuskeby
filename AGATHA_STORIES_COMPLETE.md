# ✅ Agatha Splint Story System - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 What's Been Built

### 1. Full Agatha Splint Writing Prompt ✅
**File:** `scripts/generate-story.ts`

The complete Skandi-Magisk Historieforteller-Prompt™ v2.9 is now integrated:
- ✅ Agatha's personality (warm, odd, digressive, mischievously melancholic)
- ✅ Five Literary Pillars (Lindgren, Vestly, Egner, Andersen, Jansson)
- ✅ 800+ word minimum stories
- ✅ Tea/biscuit interruptions from `oneliners.json`
- ✅ Random endings from `endings_full.json` about why it's free
- ✅ First person Agatha voice
- ✅ Narrative, not descriptive style
- ✅ Always in English
- ✅ No moral, just tiny truths

**AI Configuration:**
- Primary: GPT-4o (2500 tokens, temp 0.85)
- Fallback: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (3000 tokens)
- System prompt: "You are Agatha Splint..."

### 2. Illustration Generation System ✅
**File:** `scripts/generate-story-images.mjs`

Generates **3 illustrations per story** using Runware.ai:
- Featured image (hero/header, 1024x1024)
- First inline illustration (mid-story)
- Second inline illustration (closing scene)

**Style:** Nordic children's book illustrations
- Hand-drawn watercolor aesthetic
- Inspired by Jansson, Egner, Vestly, Andersen, Lindgren
- Warm hues, playful layouts, emotional cues
- Tiny Stickman character in each scene
- Signed "Agatha Splint" in corner
- **NOT photorealistic** - illustrative and whimsical

**Model:** HiDream-I1 Fast (runware:101@1)

### 3. Workaround for Root Permission Issue ✅
**File:** `scripts/copy-story-images.sh`

Since `/public/assets/agatha/` is root-owned, created dedicated script:
```bash
sudo sh scripts/copy-story-images.sh <story-slug>
```

This:
- Copies images from `/tmp/` to `/public/assets/agatha/story/`
- Sets correct ownership (pjuskebysverden:psacln)
- Sets correct permissions (644)
- Creates directory if needed

### 4. Story Template with Image Display ✅
**File:** `src/pages/historier/[...slug].astro`

Enhanced story pages with:
- ✅ Featured image at top (full-width, rounded corners)
- ✅ "Illustrated by Agatha Splint" caption
- ✅ Serif font (Georgia) for story text
- ✅ Larger font size (1.125rem) for readability
- ✅ Custom `<agatha-illustration>` web component for inline images
- ✅ Support for left/right/center positioning
- ✅ Schema.org structured data with image
- ✅ Updated author to "Agatha Splint" (not "Organization")

### 5. Content Schema Updates ✅
**File:** `src/content/config.ts`

Added fields:
- `hasIllustrations: boolean` - Whether Agatha images exist
- `featuredImage: string` - Path to featured image

Stories automatically include:
```yaml
hasIllustrations: true
featuredImage: "/assets/agatha/story/{slug}-featured.png"
```

### 6. Complete Workflow Script ✅
**File:** `scripts/generate-complete-story.sh`

One-command story generation:
```bash
sh scripts/generate-complete-story.sh [story-type]
```

This runs all 4 steps:
1. Generate story text with AI
2. Generate 3 illustrations
3. Copy images to public (sudo)
4. Build and deploy

### 7. Documentation ✅
**File:** `docs/AGATHA_STORIES.md`

Complete guide including:
- System overview
- Quick start commands
- Manual workflow steps
- Illustration style guide
- File structure
- Story schema
- AI configuration
- Troubleshooting
- Data sources

## 🎭 The Agatha Voice

> "Stories are like spilled sugar. Once scattered, they belong to everyone's shoes. You can't sweep them back into a box and demand coins. That's why subscribing is always free."

Every story ends with Agatha's gentle explanation of why stories should be free, paired with a metaphor (umbrellas, socks, bubbles, balloons, crumbs, etc.).
