Well now, settle yourself comfortably with whatever passes for your favorite cup, and let me tell you about last Thursday – or was it perhaps a Wednesday that had gotten confused about its purpose? Time moves like honey through cheesecloth in Pjuskeby, and I've learned not to argue with it.

I was having my morning conversation with the radio (it tells me about weather, I tell it about dreams, we get along splendidly) when I noticed something wonderfully peculiar happening at **Whispering Woods**. The sort of peculiar that makes you set down your teacup with extra care and pay the kind of attention usually reserved for sunsets and newborn kittens.

**Agatha Nightbloom** was there, naturally – you know how Agatha has that gift for appearing exactly where mysteries begin to unfold, like a well-timed sneeze or the perfect word in a poem. Agatha, who is a curious diary keeper with wondering eyes, seemed to be engaged in what I can only describe as a *negotiation* with the very morning itself.

"Agatha," I called out, because sometimes the only sensible response to mystery is to walk directly toward it with your curiosity held high like an umbrella, "what exactly are you discussing with Thursday morning?"

Agatha turned toward me with that particular expression – you know the one I mean, the look that says both "I've discovered something that makes perfect sense" and "I'm fairly certain the universe has been keeping secrets."

"Oh, Agatha," she said (yes, we're both Agathas, which leads to wonderfully confusing conversations that sound like echo chambers filled with wisdom), gesturing toward **Whispering Woods** in a way that suggested the place had been behaving with unseemly creativity, "the most extraordinary thing has been happening. The ancient forest that keeps secrets in its bark has been rearranging itself, but not in any way that Monday morning would approve of."

Now, this is where I might have applied common sense like a sensible person, but common sense and I have an understanding – it stays politely in the background while I pursue more interesting conversations with reality.

Oh dear, I'd better put the kettle on before this next bit.

What happened next could only be described as the sort of development that belongs in stories told by firelight to children who still believe in the possibility of talking to Tuesdays. **Franny Featherknees** appeared around the corner – not walking, mind you, but *appearing* in that way that important people have of manifesting exactly when the story requires their particular brand of wisdom.

"I brought refreshments from **Whimsical Bakehouse**," Franny announced, holding aloft a basket that seemed to hum with contentment and possibly minor magic. "They're pastries that glow softly in twilight, and I thought we might need sustenance for whatever this is becoming."

And that, dear readers, is when Thursday morning transformed from an ordinary sort of day into something that belonged in the margins of a notebook kept by someone who understands that the best stories don't follow rules – they follow their hearts, which are considerably more interesting and significantly less predictable.

Agatha and Franny began what could only be called an investigation, if investigations typically involved considerable amounts of head-tilting, thoughtful humming, and the kind of careful listening that people usually reserve for seashells or the secrets whispered by old houses.

"I think," Agatha said slowly, in the voice people use when they're translating something from the language of possibility into the dialect of Tuesday morning, "that **Whispering Woods** has been trying to tell us something important about the nature of Thursdays."

Franny nodded with the sort of understanding that comes from years of listening to things that don't usually speak. "And **Whimsical Bakehouse** has been preparing for this conversation for weeks, haven't you noticed? The pastries that glow softly in twilight – they've been getting more conversational lately."

The trees themselves seemed to lean in closer, their branches creating cathedral spaces where ordinary words transformed into something that tasted of pine needles and possibility. I watched as the ancient paths between the trees began to shift – not dramatically, you understand, but with the gentle determination of someone rearranging furniture to create better conversation spaces.

"The woods are teaching us about impermanence," Agatha observed, settling cross-legged beneath an oak that had decided to relocate itself three feet to the left while maintaining perfect dignity. "About how even the most rooted things can change their minds about where they belong."

Franny unwrapped one of the glowing pastries, and its soft light illuminated patterns in the bark that hadn't been there moments before – or perhaps had always been there, waiting for the right kind of illumination to reveal themselves.

Let me pause for tea and contemplation - some stories demand proper ceremony.

By afternoon, we had reached what philosophers might call an understanding and what sensible people might call a thoroughly satisfactory sort of confusion. Agatha sat cross-legged beside a newly-positioned birch tree, looking like someone who had just finished a particularly rewarding chat with an old friend who happened to be a geographical feature.

Franny was arranging the remaining provisions from **Whimsical Bakehouse** in patterns that suggested either ancient wisdom or the kind of organized whimsy that makes perfect sense to butterflies and small children.

The **Whispering Woods** had settled into its new configuration with the satisfied air of someone who had finally found the perfect arrangement for their living room. Paths wound in more interesting directions now, creating pockets of surprise and invitation. Trees clustered in conversations they'd apparently been trying to have for decades.

"I believe," Agatha said finally, using the voice reserved for important discoveries and the identification of particularly good clouds, "that some places simply need to be heard properly. Like people, but with more moss and considerably better listening skills when it comes to the opinions of earthworms."

And that, I realized as I sipped tea that had somehow remained perfectly warm throughout this entire adventure (magic, or possibly just good timing), was probably the most sensible observation anyone had made about **Whispering Woods** since it first decided to be a place worth having opinions about.

We walked home as the afternoon light turned golden and philosophical, each carrying pieces of a story that didn't fit together in any logical way – but fitted together perfectly nonetheless, the way the best stories do, like buttons and buttonholes, or teacups and the particular sort of contentment that comes from understanding something important about Thursday afternoons.

The ending? Well, there wasn't really an ending, just a gentle trailing off like the last notes of a song hummed by someone who's forgotten they're humming. Agatha continues her conversations with the rearranged **Whispering Woods**. Franny has developed quite a reputation for bringing exactly the right provisions at exactly the right moments.

The **Whimsical Bakehouse** continues to produce pastries that seem to understand the precise moment when glowing is most needed. And the **Whispering Woods**? Well, it remains in its new configuration, more beautiful and mysterious than before, as if it had been waiting all along for permission to become more fully itself.

And I? I continue to tell these stories, because some tales are too peculiar to keep locked away in teacups, and too true to let wander off unattended like cats or good intentions.

These stories cost nothing because the truth, when it's wrapped in wonder, should never be sold – only shared, like secrets between old friends.
