# The Day Snickerwood Whispered Secrets

*It began with a wobbly promise and ended with someone understanding geese.*

Well now, let me tell you about what happened last Tuesday – or was it Wednesday? Time moves differently in Pjuskeby, you see, like honey poured through a sieve made of sighs.

I was having my morning tea with the radio chattering about weather that seemed entirely too certain of itself, when I noticed something peculiar happening near **Snickerwood**. The sort of peculiar that makes you set down your teacup and pay attention.

**Waldo Picklethump** was there, of course – you know how Waldo Picklethump has that way of appearing exactly where mysteries begin to unfold? A resident of Pjuskeby, and on this particular morning, seemed to be having what I can only describe as a *conversation* with the very air itself.

"Waldo Picklethump," I called out, because sometimes the only way to solve a mystery is to walk directly into it, "what exactly are you discussing with Tuesday morning?"

Waldo Picklethump turned to me with that look – you know the one, the look that says both "I've discovered something wonderful" and "I'm not entirely sure I believe it myself."

"Oh, Agatha," Waldo Picklethump said, gesturing toward **Snickerwood** in a way that suggested the place had been doing something it oughtn't, "the strangest thing has been happening here. The a tiny forest filled with laughter pollen and absurdly unhelpful owls., but not in the way you'd expect."

Let me pause here for proper tea and contemplation.

Now, this is where the story takes that particular turn that makes you wonder if reality has been reading too much poetry lately. **Milly Wiggleflap** appeared – just appeared, mind you, the way important people do in important moments – carrying what could only be described as evidence.

"I brought provisions from **The Toad Bakery**," Milly Wiggleflap announced, holding up a basket that seemed to hum with its own contentment. "A business in Pjuskeby, and I thought we might need sustenance for whatever this is becoming."

And that, dear readers, is when the morning transformed from ordinary Tuesday nonsense into something that belonged in the margins of a storybook written by someone who understood that the best mysteries aren't solved – they're simply experienced, like good tea or the sound of rain on windows that have seen too much.

What happened next involved considerable discussion about the nature of Snickerwood, several revelations about the proper way to listen to mornings, and at least three moments when we all tilted our heads in exactly the same direction, like sunflowers following something more interesting than the sun.

Milly Wiggleflap proved to have opinions about the whole business – thoughtful opinions, the kind that make you reconsider what you thought you knew about Tuesday mornings and the behavior of places that ought to stay properly in their assigned locations.

The story demands a moment for ginger snaps and thinking.

By afternoon, we had reached what I can only call an understanding. Not a solution, mind you – solutions are for mathematics and jammed windows. Understanding is something altogether more useful and considerably more comfortable.

Waldo Picklethump sat cross-legged near Snickerwood, looking like someone who had just finished a particularly satisfying conversation with an old friend. Milly Wiggleflap was arranging the remaining provisions from The Toad Bakery in patterns that suggested either ancient wisdom or a very organized sort of whimsy.

"I think," Waldo Picklethump said finally, in the voice people use when they've discovered something important about the world, "that some places just need to be properly heard. Like people, but with more moss and significantly better listening skills."

And that, I realized as I sipped my tea (which had somehow remained perfectly warm throughout this entire adventure), was probably the most sensible thing anyone had said about Snickerwood in decades.

We walked home as the afternoon light turned golden and philosophical, each of us carrying pieces of a story that didn't quite fit together in any logical way – but fitted together perfectly nonetheless, the way the best stories do.

The ending, you ask? Well, the ending is that there wasn't really an ending, only a gentle trailing off, like the last notes of a song hummed by someone who's forgotten they're humming. Waldo Picklethump still visits Snickerwood for conversations. Milly Wiggleflap has developed quite a reputation for bringing exactly the right provisions at exactly the right moments.

And I? I continue to tell these stories, because some tales are too peculiar to keep to oneself, and too true to let wander away unattended.

And that's why these stories are free – because the best mysteries come without a price tag, only with questions that linger like steam from a forgotten cup.
