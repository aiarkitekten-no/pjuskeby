**Diary of the Day I Wore Socks on My Hands: Thoughts from Agatha Splint**

Oh! The day was weaving in and out of itself like a cat crisscrossing between piano keys, and I, Agatha Splint, found myself pondering the audacious matter of socks worn on hands. You see, some things in Pjuskeby are as unexpected as warm rain in winter, and today was no different.

It began with Percy Snootwhistle meandering down Snorklebrock Road, all 66 years of him wrapped in a coat that looked suspiciously like it once belonged to a curtain. At The Slightly Odd Bank, where he, with great dignity, apologized to bananas before peeling them, he’s as much a fixture as the accounts themselves. Today, however, was special; he wore socks on his hands as if to confuse the very notion of where things belong. He claimed it was for warmth, yet there was a glint in his eye that spoke of something deeper—a rebellion against the mundane.

Now, speaking of confusion, I must confess, I do adore it when my stories start one way and then turn altogether other. Don't we all? Imagine my delight as Trixie Wobblethorpe, the purveyor of Invisible Utensils Ltd., swirled into the scene on that very same road. She, too, had a quirk—her invisible soup spoons had brought about both marvel and mishap. Today, she was there not to peddle her wares but to muse at the philosophical delights offered at Pants & Philosophy, the shop that claims trousers and deep thought are interchangeable concepts. An idea I find both comforting and slightly unsettling, much like a morning cup of chamomile that tastes vaguely of mischief.

Oh dear, I'd better put the kettle on before this next bit.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, right before the splash. You see, Splashypaint Falls was alive with the sound of squabbling gulls and water's cheerful banter. People often leave wetter than intended, their clothes dyed in hues of unexpected laughter. Percy and Trixie met at the Falls, both drawn by a rumor that the water had started speaking in verse. A poet, if you will, that only recites when the wind breathes softly from the north-west.

As Percy and Trixie stood by the water, the Falls began their curious refrain:

"Whisper, wonder, wind and weave,
Time’s a riddle, dreams deceive.
Drop by drop, the moments flow,
Where they lead, you'll never know."

I could sense Trixie’s heart flutter like a moth at candlelight, while Percy looked at his sock-clad hands with a knowing smile. It was then the real twist unfurled itself like an old receipt found in a library book. As if coaxed by the verse, Percy stepped towards the water, his feet dancing with uncharacteristic grace. In a blink—and a splash—he vanished into the falls. Trixie let out a small gasp, not of fear, but of curiosity. Moments later, Percy reemerged, looking decidedly more dapper and dare I say, a touch younger. 

"Ten years," he murmured, giving Trixie a look that said he’d been gifted a secret only shared by the falls and their unseen poet.

Wait, hold on, I need a biscuit to process this.

There’s something intriguing about life here in Pjuskeby, where the ordinary is just a stitch away from the absurd. When Percy rejoined Trixie, they both chuckled—his laugh a little less crinkly, hers a bit more buoyant. It seems Pants & Philosophy had a new story to ponder, one that fit them like a glove, or perhaps, a sock.

As the day drew to a close, Percy and Trixie strolled back up Snorklebrock Road, arms linked in the camaraderie of shared mysteries. And me? Well, I returned to my diary, warmed by the tales of the day, as the last light crawled gently over Pjuskeby’s rooftops.

I do wonder if Percy ever wore socks on his hands again. Or if Trixie, in her inventiveness, considered invisible mittens as her next venture. But that's a tale for another day, I suppose.

Oh, just listen to me, rambling on like a river with too many bends. Time for another cup of tea, perhaps with a pinch of nonsense for flavor. I’ll leave you, dear diary, with a sigh that almost became a splash, and a story that trailed off just before the...

“Oh drat, nearly shuffled out without the note. People ask me why free—why each crumbly pun, each storm-squeaky kettle, each goose in a bowtie comes with no invoice?

Because stories are balloons tied loosely—they’ll float into anyone’s hand. I couldn’t charge for the sky. That’s why subscribing is free.

But here’s the string in your palm: sharing is careing. If a balloon bops your nose or makes your cat sneeze, let it drift to another. That’s how my balloons travel further than my short arms could toss.

Now, string or biscuit?” 🎈🍪
