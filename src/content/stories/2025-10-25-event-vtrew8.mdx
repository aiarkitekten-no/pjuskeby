**The Day Pjuskeby Found Its Way to the Sky**

Ah, dear listener, do settle in with a steaming mug of something strong and soothing. I promise today's tale will tangle your senses like yarn in a basket of kittens. Let me tell you about the peculiar day when Pjuskeby decided it was done with ordinary ground and chose to flirt a bit with the sky.

It was a Tuesday, or perhaps a Thursday—days in Pjuskeby tend to meander like a cat following the scent of fish. Franklin Gloop, who you may know as the venerable head of Weatherproof Pudding Labs, was out and about, squinting at the clouds with his magnifying monocle. Some say he was more pudding than person, and there were whispers that on particularly warm days, he might just melt into a rather pleasant dessert. But I digress. Franklin was on a mission, but not the kind you would expect from a retired pudding scientist.

Milly Wiggleflap, on the other hand, was quite convinced that clouds were merely sheep on holiday, idling in the sky with dreams of greener pastures. She was the resident expert at The Pudding Forecast Centre, though her forecasts often involved more sheep counting than actual meteorology. On this peculiar day, she was out with her kite, a delightful contraption with noodles for a tail, the perfect tool for her studies on aerial ovine behavior.

The epicenter of our unexpected adventure began at Debate Dunes, where townsfolk argued endlessly over whether pizza truly needed sausage. It was an age-old debate, fueled by the wind’s salty whispers and the sun’s coaxing winks. Franklin and Milly had arrived just in time for the crescendo of the culinary quarrel. Franklin, rather partial to fruit toppings, stood his ground with a pudding-like resilience, while Milly, distracted by the cloud shapes, let the wind take her arguments up and away.

"Oh dear, I'd better put the kettle on before this next bit," I can hear you think. And indeed, this is where things take a turn toward the delightful absurd.

As if summoned by the fervor of the debate, a mysterious business card floated down from the sky. It had the words "Waffle Oracle" emblazoned in syrupy script. Franklin caught it deftly, his monocle nearly tumbling off in surprise. Milly, eyes wide with wonder, declared it a sign from the sky-sheep.

The Waffle Oracle wasn't on any map of Pjuskeby, but the card insisted it was located on Gnomewobble Rise. Naturally, folks were intrigued. A waffle that could tell fortunes? Who could resist?

The townsfolk, united by curiosity and a shared love for waffles, gathered and set off. Gnomewobble Rise was a street that didn’t quite want to be found—it zigzagged through the town like a mischievous river. And there, tucked between the half-baked bakery and a shop selling left-handed teacups, was the Waffle Oracle. An enticing aroma wafted out, weaving through the air like a promise.

Inside, the Oracle herself was a sight to behold: Madame Syrup, a woman with hair as golden as the waffles she conjured. She was a captivating figure, with eyes that twinkled like two mischievous spoons. She invited the townsfolk in with a gesture as grand as the stories of old.

"Wait, hold on, I need a biscuit to process this," you might say. And indeed, it’s best to have a biscuit at such moments.

One by one, the townsfolk stepped forward to seek their fortune. Franklin asked about the weather, of course, hoping the waffles might confirm his latest pudding-infused forecasts. Milly inquired about the clouds—could they possibly be persuaded to rain down sheep’s wool?

The waffle responses were as varied as they were cryptic. Franklin's waffle declared that he would find the answer in the color of a sunset. Milly's assured her that the clouds were simply on a sabbatical, and to keep an eye out for sheep with sunburns.

But the true marvel occurred as Madame Syrup served the last waffle. The entire shop lifted gently, as if the waffles had grown wings of their own. Pjuskeby, that day, found itself aloft, hovering just a whisper away from the clouds.

The debate at Debate Dunes was momentarily forgotten as people peered out from windows, gazing at a world suddenly more expansive. The streets below looked like the drawings of an absent-minded artist, and the clouds, well, they seemed closer than ever—napping sheep indeed.

As the town floated gently back to ground, the folk of Pjuskeby were left enriched with stories and dreams a little bigger than before. It was said that Franklin and Milly both found answers—not in the skies, but in the shared wonder of that day.

And as I sip my tea, letting the warmth wrap around me like the softest cardigan, I wonder if perhaps, just perhaps, the town still carries a bit of that skyward yearning. But then, dear friend, who wouldn't?

And so, with a sigh, the tale drifts to its close, leaving you with the lingering scent of waffles and maybe, just maybe, a dream of your own to chase across the clouds.

“Oh dear, installment 15 nearly slipped the net. People always ask why free—why each goose-whisper, each biscuit-bump, each kettle sneeze is toll-free?

Because stories are like runaway socks. Once loose, they belong to whoever finds them under the sofa. That’s why it’s free to subscribe.

But runaway socks love company. Sharing is careing. If a story warms your toes or makes your drawer giggle, toss it along. That’s how socks and stories wander further than I ever could.

Now, sock or biscuit?” 🧦🍪
