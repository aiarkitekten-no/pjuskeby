    "description_short": "**[Origin/History]** Makeout Mountain was not always a mountain, nor was it always associated with that delightful mingling of lips and hearts. It began its existence as a particularly shy hillock known as Hemmelig Hump, which means \"Secret Bump\" in Norwegian. Local accounts suggest that during a particularly vibrant Aurora Borealis in 1637, the hillock awoke from centuries of quietude and decided to ascend into a mountain, perhaps inspired by an inexplicable longing to be closer to the celestial lights. Nobody can say for certain why the mountain became a haven for romance, though some believe it has something to do...",

    "description_short": "**[Origin/History]** The tale of Sardine Pier begins on a particularly mackerel-scented morning in Pjuskeby, long before anyone had the foggiest notion of taming the sea. The Great Sardine Tempest of 1722 rolled through the fjords, peppering the coastline with an abundance of wriggling, shimmering fish. When the storm subsided, the townsfolk—half-amused, half-bemused—found a natural pier stretching into the waters, formed entirely of tightly packed sardines. Legend claims that the pier arose from an ancient arrangement between the sea and the fish, a pact inked in the salt of the northern waves. The residents of Pjuskeby soon learned that the Sardine...",

    "description_short": "**[Origin/History]** Thinky Bay came into existence not through any grand geological event or tectonic upheaval but through the humble musings of Osloff Teakettle, the most pensive fisherman in the annals of Pjuskeby history. On a particularly foggy morning in 1847, while quietly contemplating the eternal mysteries of the deep sea, Osloff cast his line not into the choppy waters but into the air. As it turned out, it was on this very day that the sky decided it had had enough of merely reflecting the ocean's blue. In a somewhat hasty decision, it sprouted an entirely new bay right there...",

    "description_short": "**[Origin/History]** The Sunny Shimmy Shore did not have the luxury of a deliberate inception. It arose quite accidentally on an uncharted day during the late 1800s, when a particularly reckless wind named Gustaf decided to take an unsanctioned detour over Pjuskeby. Much to the surprise of the local fjord, Gustaf tugged at a sleepy collection of boulders, which had been snoozing contently for centuries, and deposited them in a haphazard row along the edge of the sea. These boulders, in their newfound enthusiasm for sunbathing, attracted grains of golden sand that whispered secret stories from distant lands. Together, they formed...",

    "description_short": "**[Origin/History]** Skitter Pebble Beach came to be in the most peculiarly causal way—by a particularly audacious wish whispered into the soft ear of a forgetful fjord. Legend has it that in the year of 1678, a fisherman named Gustaaf Fiddlenose wished for a beach that could scoot and skitter away from the encroaching cold, a place where his toes could thaw all year round. One misty midnight, under the gaze of three impossibly large moons, an ethereal kraken, dreaming of sandy shoes, nudged the seabed just so, and Skitter Pebble Beach winked into existence on the whim of that wish....",
