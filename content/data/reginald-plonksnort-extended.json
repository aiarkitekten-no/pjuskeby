  "bio_full": "**Symphony of Unintentional Sound**\n\nReginald Plonksnort was not born into noise, but rather into an excessive silence that only he seemed capable of breaking. At age 7, while most children were learning the alphabet, Reginald discovered the secret language of sound. He realized that a mistimed hiccup could disarm an argument and that the squeak of his left shoe was, in fact, a tender lullaby to cobblestones. Thus emerged his life's calling: the Symphony of Unintentional Sound.\n\nNow at a ripe 60, Reginald is the revered Maestro of Pjuskeby's Symphony of Unintentional Sound, a collective of rustling leaves, creaky staircases, and the occasional introspective raindrop. Reginald conducts these symphonies with a baton woven from particularly resonant strands of spaghetti. The performances are held every Thursday at 3:17 PM atop Gnarlehump Hill, where the wind knows well enough to carry the music over Pjuskeby with a sigh and a curtsy. Reginald insists that the best symphonies are the ones that blend beautifully with the ambient sounds of daily life—like the stifled giggle of a distant raven or the creak of a well-patted accordion. Villagers often leave with newfound appreciation for the incidental melodies in their own lives, and sometimes with a breadstick, because Reginald believes in feeding both the soul and the stomach.\n\n**Cough Harmonics**\n\nReginald is an accidental virtuoso in the art of cough harmonics, a talent that revealed itself one pollen-heavy autumn. Each cough, a distinct note, formed melodies that encaptured the spirit of lost Norse ballads. He keeps a journal titled \"The Chronicles of Splutter and Sneeze\" where he notates each cough occurrence: date, time, and the exact pitch his bronchial surprise produces. The journal itself is a hefty tome bound in seal fur, with pages that rustle like reeds in a gentle fjord breeze.\n\nHis collection of cough recordings, all cataloged on wax cylinders, is nothing short of astounding. \"Symphony in A-flat Ahem\" and \"The Concerto of the Common Cold\" are among his most celebrated works, and they feature on Radio Pjuskeby’s \"Unexpected Classics\" hour every Sunday morning. Critics claim his cough harmonics have an emotional depth that words simply can't capture, likening them to the nostalgic echo of a snowflake landing on the nose of a sleeping bear.\n\n**Daily Ritual**\n\nEach dawn, Reginald begins his day with a ritual steeped in musical chaos and caffeinated calm. At precisely 5:47 AM, he wakes to the soft peal of his alarm clock—a vintage contraption named Berthold, who only responds to the tap dance of a toothbrush on its brass rim. Reginald then greets the morning with a waltz-sneeze, a curious habit developed during a childhood encounter with an overzealous bagpipe.\n\nDressed in his polka-dotted dressing gown, Reginald ventures to his kitchen where his kettle, affectionately named Mildred, whistles in D-sharp. Every morning, he orchestrates a conversation between Mildred's whistle and the gurgle of his coffee percolator, which he has lovingly nicknamed Percival. The symphony concludes with a flourish as the toaster, Jean-Claude, delivers a triumphant two-slice finale.\n\nAfter breakfast, Reginald attends to his flock of brass doorknobs, each meticulously tuned to a different key. He polishes them one by one, ensuring their resonance carries a melody into the heart of every visitor. His neighbors, accustomed to Reginald's symphonic antics, start their own days to the gentle sounds of his doorknobs chiming in the breeze, blessing their mornings with the sound of music in an otherwise silent village.\n\n**What Reginald Loves**\n\nReginald adores the unexpected moments of harmony that life delivers. He loves the symphonic cacophony of the town’s bustling market, where the soft thud of rutabagas against a wooden cart blends with the high-pitched laughter of children chasing runaway turnips. He has a particular fondness for socks that don't match, believing they carry the memories of different adventures—his own feet clad in the tales spun by a stripe on the left and a polka dot on the right.\n\nHe treasures the annual Pjuskeby Jazz Festival, where he can immerse himself in the language of his thoughts, and dreams of composing a symphony entirely from the sounds of delighted festival-goers munching on ludefisk and whispering secrets to the fjord breeze. And above all, Reginald loves the rare moments when his thoughts in jazz sync perfectly with a sneeze in waltz, a celestial alignment that occurs but once in a blue moon.\n\n**What Reginald Hates**\n\nDespite his immense affection for sound, Reginald has a deep-seated aversion to silence so profound it feels like forgetting. Quiet, to him, is an incomplete sentence, a song that never finds its rhythm. The stillness of a heavily snowed winter's night brings him a melancholic discomfort, a reminder of symphonies left unsung. He detests missed notes, both in music and in life, and he holds a particular grudge against the solitary hiccup that disrupts an otherwise perfect meal.\n\nHe finds conversation without laughter to be akin to a melody without a chorus, and he utterly loathes avocados, claiming they are the mute buttons of the fruit world, silencing the joyful crunch of a well-placed pickle in a sandwich.\n\n**Future Dreams of Reginald Plonksnort**\n\nReginald dreams of a legacy that echoes through Pjuskeby long after his final sneeze has waltzed into the twilight. He envisions a grand concert, \"The Harmony of Happenstance,\" where townsfolk and nature join in synchronous sound. He plans to conduct this event at the peak of Mount Guffaw, where laughter and echo are old friends.\n\nIn his twilight years, he hopes to pass down his Symphony of Unintentional Sound to the next generation of accidental musicians. His dream is to inspire them to find music in the mundane, to cherish the songs hidden within hiccups, sneezes, and the ting of a spoon against an empty coffee cup.\n\nReginald Plonksnort would like nothing more than to be remembered as the man who taught Pjuskeby to listen to the world's subtle symphonies, and, if he has his way, to leave behind a small orchestra of nostalgic doorknobs, each singing softly in the wind.",
