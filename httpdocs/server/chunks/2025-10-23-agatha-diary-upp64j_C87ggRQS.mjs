I was on my way to see Nora Bumblebash at her beloved Aquarium of Forgotten Feelings. There, fish swim in circles of ennui and occasional flashes of embarrassment, mostly when the local children press their noses too eagerly against the glass. Nora swears she’s seen a trout blush – and who am I to argue with a woman who’s shared secrets with starfish?"

Hats inside are not simply hats; they are journeys for the imagination, each with its own quirks and whispers."

Milly, bless her woolly heart, maintains that clouds are nothing more than lazy sheep who’ve taken to lounging in the sky. Yesterday, however, she seemed to be engaged in more than idle chatter. It was as if the clouds were debating back."

I could almost taste the Earl Grey of it all."

It was then that I noticed something odd—a distinct lack of nudging. The legal requirement on Bumpity Pass was being neglected, and I felt a tickle of mystery at the nape of my neck. Not wanting to disturb the atmospheric discussion, I decided a biscuit was essential. “Wait, hold on, I need a biscuit to process this.”"
