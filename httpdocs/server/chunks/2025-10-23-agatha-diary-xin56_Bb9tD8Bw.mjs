Here in Thinky Bay, the air is thick with the ponderings of gulls, who, as usual, squabble about trivial matters – like whether the sun rises or merely hops up for a stretch."

      children: "Now, let me tell you about the peculiar events that unfolded on this ticklishly confusing Tuesday. It all began with Clive Flumpington, a septuagenarian of the most curious profession. As a senior member of The Illuminated Bureau of Naming Things, Clive possessed the unique talent of knowing the secret name of every lamppost in town. Oh, he could whisper their true names, and they’d flicker in delight. It’s a rare gift, the sort that makes one wonder whether lampposts, like cats, have nine lives or simply one name too many."
    }), "\n", createVNode(_components.p, {
      children: "Clive’s daily ritual involved ambling down Muddlemoose Alley, greeting each luminary with a nod and a name. But on this particular morning, as Clive approached the corner lamppost – Geraldine, if I recall correctly – something was amiss. Geraldine did not flicker, dim, or respond in any way. She stood there, awkwardly silent, as if she’d forgotten herself amidst the hubbub of Muddlemoose traffic."
    }), "\n", createVNode(_components.p, {
      children: "“Oh dear,” Clive mumbled, scratching his head, which was covered with a hat that appeared to have been chewed by a particularly critical squirrel. “It seems Geraldine has lost her name.” And with that, Clive dashed off to The Department of Lost Echoes for assistance. But before I dive into that peculiar detour, let me pause to brew a comforting cup of tea. Oh dear, I’d better put the kettle on before this next bit."
    }), "\n", createVNode(_components.p, {
      children: "Now, where was I? Ah yes, The Department of Lost Echoes, where lost sounds are carefully catalogued and, if found, returned to their rightful owners. It’s a place of peculiar magic, where whispers are boxed and laughter is bottled for those who’ve forgotten how. Clive, feeling rather out of sorts, hoped they’d have a spare name tucked away somewhere."
    }), "\n", createVNode(_components.p, {
      children: "Enter Boris Blundercheek, a man of sixty-three years who claims to have invented accidental walking – a talent he’s very proud of, though others remain skeptical about its practicality. Boris was the first person Clive encountered upon entering the Department. As usual, Boris was practicing the art of stumbling into things with a flourish. Today it was the register desk, yesterday it was a particularly disgruntled plant."

    }), "\n", createVNode(_components.p, {
      children: "But before Clive could inquire further, Boris disappeared into a cupboard labeled “Staff Only” and, remarkably, returned almost immediately. Except now he appeared a week older, with a beard that had grown in the blink of an eye and shoes that had developed a squeak of their own."

After much whispering and shuffling of papers that seemed to rustle with secrets of their own, she presented Clive with a tiny vial."
