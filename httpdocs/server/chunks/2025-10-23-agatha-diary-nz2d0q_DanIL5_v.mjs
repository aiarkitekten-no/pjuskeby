It started with a breeze that smelled of forgotten promises and ended with Rattle Hill singing an old lullaby. But let me not get ahead of myself—every good story must start somewhere, even if it ends nowhere in particular."

The cobblestones giggled under my feet, and the air was busy with the chatter of distant cuckoo clocks. On days like these, it feels as though the town is half-awake, dreaming of something both familiar and strange."

Vera cleans invisible messes, a task that perplexes many but seems to soothe her very soul. Her eyes twinkle with the satisfaction of order, even when there is none to be seen. Today, she was out on Rattle Hill, polishing the air with a fervor that suggested last night’s dream had left some smudges. Every swoosh of her duster was like a whisper from the past, brushing against the present."

Franny has a peculiar habit of talking to chairs before sitting down, a practice she insists is rooted in good manners. “You never know if a chair’s had a rough day,” she often says, gently patting the armrests as if consoling an old friend."

One seat over, Vera nodded approvingly, evidently glad that someone understood the importance of acknowledging the unseen."

As the sun lazily made its way across the sky, a chorus of creaking echoed from Chair Whisperers Inc. down the street. A company whose sole purpose is to interpret the woolly words of furniture, Chair Whisperers Inc. had recently been abuzz with reports of chairs feeling out of sorts, their once-contented creaks turning into existential sighs."

Franny claimed that one of her chairs revealed a yearning for adventure, while Vera swore she heard a stool declare its desire to become a stepladder. As the conversations continued, Rattle Hill began to hum along, the very earth beneath us vibrating with whimsy and wonder."

One moment she was there, and the next, she was not. When she re-emerged, she appeared much the same, save for a few silver strands that seemed to have acquired stories of their own."
