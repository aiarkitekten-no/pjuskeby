She held firm to the notion that spoons were not just mere implements, but rather tiny boats waiting for an adventure across the gulfs of teacups and puddles. On many a morning, you might catch her launching a teaspoon into Myrtle’s Suspicious Soup – the concoctions there being as mysterious and varied as a riddle told by a seagull."

The air was alive with the scent of Myrtle’s soup bubbling nearby, mingling those suspicious scents with the anticipation of maritime mischief. As Daisy launched her spoons, Vera scurried about with a frantic feather duster, polishing the breeze and tidying the very whispers of the wind."

Others insist that Daisy, caught up in the fervor of her nautical dreams, had simply forgotten that spoons are inherently mischievous when given the notion of buoyancy."

They caught these murmurs – secrets of a thousand unspoken moments – and filled their hollow bodies with tales untold."

They would recall how on that sunny day, spoons had swum with secrets and invisible messes revealed the dances they’d always known. Pjuskeby, after all, was a place where peculiar potions brewed, and everything – even a spoon – could find its own peculiar path."
