As I sit here, in my creaky chair that seems to have too many opinions, I find myself pondering the peculiar happenings in our dear Thinky Bay. Not that I’ve ever known it to be a place of ordinary affairs. Why, just last week, Milly Wiggleflap from The Pudding Forecast Centre was heard lamenting, “Those clouds! Lazy, woolly sheep that they are, refusing to work a proper drizzle!” And if one peers closely enough, you can almost see the clouds roll over in indolent agreement."

An odd, enchanting little place where the fish seem to carry secrets older than the town itself. Nora, bless her heart, firmly believes that fish can feel embarrassment. And why not? I’ve seen Goldgill, the pearl-scaled beauty, hide behind a pebble after the lights accidentally revealed her reflection."
    }), "\n", createVNode(_components.p, {
      children: "Nevertheless, Nora found herself in the midst of a mystery that rippled through Thinky Bay. It all began with Krumplehorn Mechanics on Burpleflop Terrace. Strange noises, like the whispers of old engine ghosts, were reportedly emanating from the shop. Of course, Mr. Krumplehorn insisted it was merely the sound of “gears settling into a different dimension.” The town wasn’t convinced, but we were rather fond of Mr. Krumplehorn’s imaginative explanations."

I saw the fish of old, blushing at their own reflections in ancient waters.” Now, Nora had always been one to see fish in a different light, but this—this was something truly wonderful."

The townsfolk, upon hearing Nora’s tale, began to regard the cupboard with a sort of reverence. It wasn’t long before it became a fixture at Krumplehorn Mechanics, alongside the rattling engines and the occasional whispering gear."

Not with certainty or finality, but with the recognition that in our little town, stories are both the beginning and the end, sometimes both at once. Oh dear, I’d better put the kettle on before this next bit—I believe I may have some dreaming to do."
